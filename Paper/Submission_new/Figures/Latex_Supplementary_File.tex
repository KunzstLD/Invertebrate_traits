The definition is quoted if it enables differences to be identified, otherwise the differences are described. The hyphen indicates a missing trait. Reproduction was captured in multiple grouping features per database. Hence, differences for reproduction have been described in the paper. Body form traits are not different between databases, except that the Vieira database contains the trait Bluff (blocky) which does not appear in the other databases.}

\subsubsection*{Effect of phylogeny and trait variability on aggregation outcomes}


To examine the influence of phylogeny and trait variability on the outcomes of the different trait aggregation methods, we created three hypothetical scenarios. We simulated three different families, each containing 25 total species but with different phylogenetic structures. The three families consisted of (1) a family with an equal number of genera and species (five genera each with five species each), denoted as \textit{sim\_base}; (2) a family in which one genus had a much larger number of species than the other four genera (1 genus with 13 species, 4 genera with 3 species each), denoted as \textit{sim\_extreme}; (3) a family in which all genera had a different number of species (8, 2, 7, 3, 5), denoted as \textit{sim\_variation}. We assigned a hypothetical grouping feature with three traits (T1, T2, and T3) to each scenario. We then simulated the 25 affinities, one per species, for each trait, by sampling from a truncated normal distribution bound by 0 and 1 and with a mean value of 0.5. To simulate different levels of trait variability, we repeated the sampling 100 times for each of the 5 standard deviations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1), resulting in 12,500 simulated trait affinities for each simulated trait ($25$ species per family $\times$ 5 levels of trait variability $\times$ 100 replicates). We converted simulated trait affinities to proportions, as was done during trait database processing, and assigned the 12,500 simulated affinities per trait to each of the three family scenarios. We then applied the five trait aggregation methods described above to each simulated dataset. We compared the resulting ranges of aggregated trait affinities between levels of trait variability and phylogenetic scenario as well as the differences in trait affinities obtained by each aggregation method.


\paragraph*{Results: Comparison of aggregation methods with varying phylogenies and trait variability}
\hfill
\\

The simulations showed that both phylogenetic structure and trait variability affected aggregated trait affinities, although only to a small degree, and that aggregation method mattered in terms of the ranges of trait affinities produced over simulation replicates. The effect of phylogenetic structure differed across aggregation methods, but, as we expected, the range of trait affinities increased with increasing trait variability for all aggregation methods (Figure \ref{fig:overview_sim_results}). 

Phylogenetic structure appeared to influence the outcomes of the different aggregation methods. For the \textit{sim\_base} scenario (equal numbers of genera and species), the mean aggregation methods yielded similar ranges of aggregated trait affinities within each level of trait variability, and the median aggregation methods consistently produced greater ranges of aggregated trait affinities than the other methods. The largest ranges were produced by the \textit{stepwise\_agg \textsubscript{median}} method. For the more complex phylogenetic structures, \textit{sim\_extreme} (one genus with a much larger number of species than the other four) and \textit{sim\_variation} (all genera with a different number of species), the \textit{stepwise\_agg \textsubscript{median}} method still produced the largest ranges of trait affinities for most levels of trait variability (and \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} produced the narrowest ranges for most levels of trait variability), but there was much less consistency in the ranges of trait affinities for all aggregation methods (i.e., the ranges were different among all aggregation methods).

Although trait aggregation methods were affected by phylogenetic structure and trait variability to some degree, in most simulated datasets, the different aggregation methods resulted in similar trait affinities. Only 1.4 \%, or 213 out of 15.000 total comparisons (3 scenarios $\times$ 5 levels of trait variability $\times$ 10 unique comparisons of trait aggregation methods $\times$ 100 replicates) showed a difference equal or greater than an absolute trait affinity of 0.1. Most  (83.5 \%) of these differences occurred in the \textit{sim\_extreme} scenario and were found between the aggregation methods \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{weighted\_agg} (Figure \ref{fig:sim_indv_runs}).
