The definition is quoted if it enables differences to be identified, otherwise the differences are described. Bullet points indicate when several traits have been used to describe a morphological or behavioural property. The hyphen indicates a missing trait. Reproduction was captured in multiple grouping features per database. Hence, differences for reproduction have been described in the paper.

\subsubsection*{Effect of phylogeny and trait variability on aggregation outcomes}


To examine the influence of phylogeny and trait variability on the outcomes of the different trait aggregation methods, we created three hypothetical scenarios. We simulated three different families, each containing 25 total species but with different phylogenetic structures. The three families consisted of (1) a family with an equal number of genera and species (five genera each with five species each), denoted as \textit{sim\_base}; (2) a family in which one genus had a much larger number of species than the other four genera (1 genus with 13 species, 4 genera with 3 species each), denoted as \textit{sim\_extreme}; (3) a family in which all genera had a different number of species (8, 2, 7, 3, 5), denoted as \textit{sim\_variation}. We assigned a hypothetical grouping feature with three traits (T1, T2, and T3) to each scenario. We then simulated the 25 affinities, one per species, for each trait, by sampling from a truncated normal distribution bound by 0 and 1 and with a mean value of 0.5. To simulate different levels of trait variability, we repeated the sampling 100 times for each of the 5 standard deviations (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1), resulting in 12,500 simulated trait affinities for each simulated trait ($25$ species per family $\times$ 5 levels of trait variability $\times$ 100 replicates). We converted simulated trait affinities to proportions, as was done during trait database processing, and assigned the 12,500 simulated affinities per trait to each of the three family scenarios. We then applied the five trait aggregation methods described above to each simulated dataset. We compared the resulting ranges of aggregated trait affinities between levels of trait variability and phylogenetic scenario as well as the differences in trait affinities obtained by each aggregation method.


\paragraph*{Results: Comparison of aggregation methods with varying phylogenies and trait variability}
\hfill
\\

The simulations showed that both phylogenetic structure and trait variability affected aggregated trait affinities, although only to a small degree, and that aggregation method mattered in terms of the ranges of trait affinities produced over simulation replicates. The effect of phylogenetic structure differed across aggregation methods, but, as we expected, the range of trait affinities increased with increasing trait variability for all aggregation methods (Figure \ref{fig:overview_sim_results}). 

Phylogenetic structure appeared to influence the outcomes of the different aggregation methods. For the \textit{sim\_base} scenario (equal numbers of genera and species), the mean aggregation methods yielded similar ranges of aggregated trait affinities within each level of trait variability, and the median aggregation methods consistently produced greater ranges of aggregated trait affinities than the other methods. The largest ranges were produced by the \textit{stepwise\_agg \textsubscript{median}} method. For the more complex phylogenetic structures, \textit{sim\_extreme} (one genus with a much larger number of species than the other four) and \textit{sim\_variation} (all genera with a different number of species), the \textit{stepwise\_agg \textsubscript{median}} method still produced the largest ranges of trait affinities for most levels of trait variability (and \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} produced the narrowest ranges for most levels of trait variability), but there was much less consistency in the ranges of trait affinities for all aggregation methods (i.e., the ranges were different among all aggregation methods).

Although trait aggregation methods were affected by phylogenetic structure and trait variability to some degree, in most simulated datasets, the different aggregation methods resulted in similar trait affinities. Only 1.4 \%, or 213 out of 15.000 total comparisons (3 scenarios $\times$ 5 levels of trait variability $\times$ 10 unique comparisons of trait aggregation methods $\times$ 100 replicates) showed a difference equal or greater than an absolute trait affinity of 0.1. Most  (83.5 \%) of these differences occurred in the \textit{sim\_extreme} scenario and were found between the aggregation methods \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{weighted\_agg} (Figure \ref{fig:sim_indv_runs}).

\paragraph*{Discussion: Comparison of aggregation methods with varying phylogenies and trait variability}
\hfill
\\

We expected that, in addition to averaging measures, different weighting approaches to aggregation (i.e., equal weight to each taxon, equal weight to each genus, or weighted by number of species) would affect affinities for families with varying phylogenetic structure. However, we found through simulations that trait variability had a greater effect on the range of affinities (i.e., greater ranges of affinities at higher levels of variance) and on the differences in affinities between weighting approaches. In the simulation, taxonomic structural unevenness appeared to produce some variation in affinities among weighting approaches, especially for a family where one genus had a much larger number of species than its other genera. The comparison between aggregated and assigned traits showed, that the number of differing cases and the mean absolute differences in trait affinities, as well as the distributions of absolute trait affinity differences to assigned traits, were similar across the mean aggregation and across the median aggregation methods, which suggests a small influence of the weighting approach on the aggregation outcomes. The minor impact of the weighting approaches on trait aggregation might be explained by the fact that a considerable portion of taxa had low numbers of genera or species. Of the taxa that were compared from the North American trait dataset, 14 \% were identified at family and 62 \% at genus level, 52 \% comprised five or fewer genera, and 13 \% contained just one genus (Figure \ref{fig:tax_hierarchy_NOA}). In the Australian dataset, 21 \% of the compared taxa were identified at family, 40 \% at genus, and 39 \% at species level, 68 \% of the taxa contained five or fewer genera, and 40 \% just one genus (Figure \ref{fig:tax_hierarchy_AUS}). Hence, these results could change when more species-level trait information becomes available. Our findings show that the choice of aggregation method may matter less when phylogenetic structure is fairly even and traits are less variable, but the \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}} method tended to produce the widest range in affinities, especially with high taxonomic unevenness and high trait variability.

\subsubsection*{Fourth corner analysis}

We selected the ecologically relevant traits identified by \citet{szocs_effects_2014} that increased (shredder, life cycle duration $ > 1 $ year, gills, bi/multivoltine, ovoviviparity) or decreased (univoltine, eggs in clutches/cemented or fixed, life cycle duration $ <= 1$ year) with increasing salinity and used these in the fourth corner analysis. The selected traits have also reacted to salinity in other studies (but see the discussion in \citet{szocs_effects_2014}). 

For some sites, environmental and abundance data have been sampled multiple times per year. \citet{szocs_effects_2014} used the full data and did not consider repeated sampling. We applied two analysis: one where we did not consider multiple samplings. And second where we selected, for the sites with multiple samplings, only those sampling events with the highest macroinvertebrate abundances per year and accordingly only used the conductivity data for these sampling events (this was not done for the RDA approach).Fourth corner analysis was carried out in R with the \textit{fourthcorner()} function from the ade4 package.

Fourth corner analysis detected fewer trait-conductivity relationships than the RDA approach. With the original dataset significant relationships to conductivity were found for the traits shredder and ovoviviparity. In three out of the six aggregated and harmonised datasets (\textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}}, \textit{weighted\_agg}, \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{median}}) four significant relationships (for the traits univoltinism, bi/multivoltine, ovoviviparity, and aquatic oviposition) were detected. In the remaining three datasets (\textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{mean}}, and harmonised (not aggregated)) two significant relationships for the traits univoltinism and bi/multivoltinism were detected (Table \ref{stab:fc_selected_reduced}). Results were only slightly different when not considering multiple samplings (original dataset: two significant trait-conductivity relationship (bi-multivoltine, ovoviviparity), other datasets two to four, Table \ref{stab:fc_selected_full}). For all significant trait-conductivity relationships, the classification into characteristic traits for downstream and upstream sites was consistent with the results of the RDA analysis.
