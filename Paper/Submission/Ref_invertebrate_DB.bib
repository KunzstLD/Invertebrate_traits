To provide a framework for the trait analysis, a data base was developed; it stored biological information about 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Twenty-two variables describing biological and ecological traits were resolved into a number of simple attributes. A fuzzy coding procedure was used to describe the link between taxa and variables. Three strategies, using simple descriptive statistics or multivariate ordination techniques, were examined in their abilities to demonstrate some of the characteristics of the environment and to bring out clear information on the rate of changes in habitats. We used the Loire River, France, as a specific example. Like faunal analyses, trait analyses showed that a major change occurred in the community in the upper reaches of the river, but transition zones that were not detected with faunal data alone, were discriminated. They corresponded to differences in combinations of biological and ecological traits of communities and were linked to tributary influences (e.g. the Allier–Loire confluence) or anthropogenic disturbances: dams (Grangent, Villerest) or urban zones (Le Puy, Tours). We concluded that the species trait approach had the potential to evaluate the actual state of ecosystems, to discriminate among different types of human impact, and to develop monitoring tools considering the functional diversity of communities.},

        abstract = {1 Relating species traits to habitat characteristics can provide important insights into the structure and functioning of stream communities. However, trade-offs among species traits make it difficult to predict accurately the functional diversity of freshwater communities. Many authors have pointed to the value of working with groups of organisms as similar as possible in terms of relationships among traits and have called for definition of groups of organisms with similar suites of attributes. 2 We used multivariate analyses to examine separately the relationships among 11 biological traits and among 11 ecological traits of 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa (mainly genera). The main objective was to demonstrate (1) potential trade-offs among traits; (2) the importance of the different traits to separate systematic units or functional groupings; and (3) uniform functional groups of taxa that should allow a more effective use of macroinvertebrate biological and ecological traits. 3 We defined eight groups and 15 subgroups according to a biological trait ordination which highlighted size (large to small), reproductive traits (K to r strategists), food (animal to plant material) and feeding habits (predator to scraper and/or deposit feeder) as ‘significant’ factors determining the ordination of taxa. This ordination partly preserved phylogenetic relationships among groups. 4 Seven ecological groups and 13 ecological subgroups included organisms with combinations of traits which should be successively more adequate in habitats from the main channel to temporary waters, and from the crenon to the potamic sections of rivers, and to systems situated outside the river floodplain. These gradients corresponded to a gradual shift from (1) rheophilic organisms that lived in the main channel of cold oligotrophic mountain streams to (2) animals that preferred eutrophic habitats of still or temporary waters in lowlands. The groups with similar ecological traits had a more diverse systematic structure than those with similar biological traits. 5 Monitoring and assessment tools for the management of water resources are generally more effective if they are based on a clear understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the presence or absence of species groups in the environment. We believe that groups with similar relationships among their species traits may be useful in developing tools that measure the functional diversity of communities.},

	title = {A Database of Lotic Invertebrate Traits for North America},
	abstract = {The assessment and study of stream communities may be enhanced if functional characteristics such as life-history, habitat preference, and reproductive strategy were more widely available for specific taxa. Species traits can be used to develop these functional indicators because many traits directly link functional roles of organisms with controlling environmental factors (for example, flow, substratum, temperature). In addition, some functional traits may not be constrained by taxonomy and are thus applicable at multiple spatial scales. Unfortunately, a comprehensive summary of traits for North American invertebrate taxa does not exist. Consequently, the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water-Quality Assessment Program in cooperation with Colorado State University compiled a database of traits for North American invertebrates. A total of 14,127 records for over 2,200 species, 1,165 genera, and 249 families have been entered into the database from 967 publications, texts and reports. Quality-assurance procedures indicated error rates of less than 3 percent in the data entry process. Species trait information was most complete for insect taxa. Traits describing resource acquisition and habitat preferences were most frequently reported, whereas those describing physiological tolerances and reproductive biology were the least frequently reported in the literature. The database is not exhaustive of the literature for North American invertebrates and is biased towards aquatic insects, but it represents a first attempt to compile traits in a web-accessible database. This report describes the database and discusses important decisions necessary for identifying ecologically relevant, environmentally sensitive, non-redundant, and statistically tractable traits for use in bioassessment programs.},

	abstract = {1. Using world-wide data on the reproductive biology of 131 species (in eight orders) of aquatic insects, we used multivariate analyses to examine: (i) relationships among reproductive traits determining life cycle, fecundity, morphology, behaviour and physiology; (ii) relationships among traits determining spatial and temporal habitat characteristics at different scales; and (iii) the relationship between reproductive and habitat-use traits. This provided a test of predictions of the habitat templet concept on trends of species traits along gradients of habitat heterogeneity. 2. The major trends observed in the relationships among reproductive traits were that larger females had larger eggs, which were more vulnerable to perturbations such as droughts and often laid in cocoons. In addition, they laid the eggs in larger numbers of smaller clutches than smaller females. Other traits (e.g. egg number or incubation time) did not show clear trends. 3. Females that deposited eggs at sites of low local temporal heterogeneity (within plants) used, at the same time, gross habitats of high temporal heterogeneity (temporary waters). In contrast, traits in habitat use hardly differed on well-known gradients of temporal heterogeneity along running waters (from source to estuary). The number of habitat units used by ovipositing females generally increased with the spatial scale considered, most species oviposited in a single small habitat unit but in several gross habitats. 4. A significant (P {\textless} 0.01) relationship between traits in reproduction and habitat use demonstrated that habitat acted as a templet for reproductive strategies. This relationship was dominated by larger females having larger, unattached eggs which were more vulnerable to droughts and were oviposited in temporally more stable small-scale habitats (within wood or macrophytes, or within cocoons spun by the female) but more unstable large-scale habitats (primarily temporary waters). Thus, only on the small habitat scale did some of our observations correspond to the predictions of the habitat templet concept (e.g. larger size or higher vulnerability in more stable habitats). However, many species had traits in reproduction that did not show trends as predicted by the concept. 5. This and other recent studies of the relationships between traits of freshwater organisms and the heterogeneity of their habitats have shown that habitat acts as a templet for species life history traits. However, many of the details observed in these studies did not correspond to predictions of the templet concept because of trade-offs among the traits and scale problems in the description of habitat heterogeneity. Therefore, future studies should focus on groups of organisms which are as similar as possible in the trade-offs among their species traits and on the potential relationships of habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales.},

The main question was: Are biological traits able to reflect “biological functionality” in large rivers and if so, is it possible to deduce an assessment system based on functionality? Analysis of the raw trait structure of all species indicates that these traits are not completely independent from their higher systematic units. To avoid mis-interpretations when judging from mixtures of habitats (β-biocoenosis) we used for our investigations only sample series from α-biocoenosis, pre-tested by a mathematical criterion of homogeneity. Within α-biocoenosis, traits are shown to be able to compensate for drastic changes with respect to species number and species composition along a river continuum, demonstrating their functional quality. Long-term changes in the trait and species structures of German waterways were studied using multivariate methods, based on an analysis of 142 sampling series. A shift from traits typical for K-strategists to traits typical for r-strategists was detected to be the main background variable. The {rK}-strategy is regarded as a true functional character of species. We calculated the relative positions of all trait-coded species on this {rK}-scale, and plotted the functional diversity of our samples against the structural diversity of the species from several river systems. Rivers extremely dominated by r-strategists show a deficit in functional diversity. Rivers dominated by K-strategists also show deficits, possibly in concordance with modern ecological theories such as the intermediate disturbance theory. The quantitative proportions of extreme r- to K-Strategists in α-biocoenosis can be used as a general disturbance measure.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} 1 We present an unconventional procedure (fuzzy coding) to structure biological and environmental information, which uses positive scores to describe the affinity of a species for different modalities (i.e. categories) of a given variable. Fuzzy coding is essential for the synthesis of long?term ecological data because it enables analysis of diverse kinds of biological information derived from a variety of sources (e.g. samples, literature). 2 A fuzzy coded table can be processed by correspondence analysis. An example using aquatic beetles illustrates the properties of such a fuzzy correspondence analysis. Fuzzy coded tables were used in all articles of this issue to examine relationships between spatial?temporal habitat variability and species traits, which were obtained from a long?term study of the Upper Rhône River, France. 3 Fuzzy correspondence analysis can be programmed with the equations given in this paper or can be performed using {ADE} (Environmental Data Analysis) software that has been adapted to analyse such long?term ecological data. On Macintosh {AppleTM} computers, {ADE} performs simple linear ordination, more recently developed methods (e.g. principal component analysis with respect to instrumental variables, canonical correspondence analysis, co?inertia analysis, local and spatial analyses), and provides a graphical display of results of these and other types of analysis (e.g. biplot, mapping, modelling curves). 4 {ADE} consists of a program library that exploits the potential of the {HyperCardTM} interface. {ADE} in an open system, which offers the user a variety of facilities to create a specific sequence of programs.

	abstract = {Streams in mediterranean regions have highly seasonal discharge patterns, with predictable torrential ﬂoods and severe droughts. In contrast, discharge is less variable in temperate regions and intermittent ﬂow conditions are uncommon. Hydroclimatic models predict that climate change would increase frequency and severity of ﬂoods and droughts across Europe, thus increasing the proportion of streams with mediterranean characteristics in actually temperate areas. Correspondingly, understanding actual ecological differences between mediterranean and temperate streams may help to anticipate large-scale ecological impacts of climate change. Given that large-scale factors determine local community composition, we hypothesized that climatic differences between mediterranean and temperate regions should affect the taxonomic and biological trait composition in streams. We assembled the abundance of stream macroinvertebrate genera of 265 sites each from the Mediterranean Basin and from temperate Europe and linked these abundances to published information on 61 categories of 11 biological traits reﬂecting the potential of resilience from and resistance to disturbances. Although regional taxonomic richness was higher in the mediterranean than in the temperate region, local taxonomic richness and diversity did not signiﬁcantly differ between regions. Local trait richness and diversity were signiﬁcantly higher in the mediterranean region. Both local taxonomic and traitcommunity composition differed between regions, but the former varied much more than the latter, highlighting that climate change could produce large changes in the taxonomic but rather weak changes in the trait composition. The mediterranean region was characterized by macroinvertebrates with higher dispersion and colonization capabilities, suggesting that species loss in the temperate region, by extinction or northward emigration of taxa, would be compensated for by immigration of southern mediterranean taxa. Thus, climate change would likely have stronger implications for the local conservation of taxa than for the trait composition of stream macroinvertebrate communities.},

The {SPEARsalinity} indicator showed a reasonably high relationship (0.38 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.5) with salinity in terms of logarithmic electrical conductivity (log {EC}) using ﬁeld biomonitoring data from 835 pools and rifﬂe sites in Victoria and South Australia. Several other biotic indexes that were calculated for comparison purpose exhibited a lower relationship with log {EC}. In addition, {SPEARsalinity} was the only indicator that did not respond to other water quality variables and was therefore most selective. We used log {EC} data and modelled pesticide exposure for sites in Victoria in concert with {SPEARsalinity} and the existing {SPEARpesticides} index to assess whether pesticides interacts with effects of salinity on invertebrate communities and vice versa. No interaction with pesticides was found for the effect of log {EC} on {SPEARsalinity}, whereas {EC} interacted with the estimated pesticide exposure on the invertebrate communities. To foster the development of further trait-based ecological indicators, we suggest a conceptual model that predicts response traits based on the disturbance regime and disturbance mode of action of the stressor. Biotic indicators based on a priori selected traits represent a promising biomonitoring tool even for regions where ecological information is scarce.},

	abstract = {Climate is the predominant environmental driver of freshwater assemblage pattern on large spatial scales, and traits of freshwater organisms have shown considerable potential to identify impacts of climate change. Although several studies suggest traits that may indicate vulnerability to climate change, the empirical relationship between freshwater assemblage trait composition and climate has been rarely examined on large scales. We compared the responses of the assumed climate-associated traits from six grouping features to 35 bioclimatic indices ({\textasciitilde}18 km resolution) for five insect orders (Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Plecoptera and Trichoptera), evaluated their potential for changing distribution pattern under future climate change and identified the most influential bioclimatic indices. The data comprised 782 species and 395 genera sampled in 4,752 stream sites during 2006 and 2007 in Germany ({\textasciitilde}357,000 km² spatial extent). We quantified the variability and spatial autocorrelation in the traits and orders that are associated with the combined and individual bioclimatic indices. Traits of temperature preference grouping feature that are the products of several other underlying climate-associated traits, and the insect order Ephemeroptera exhibited the strongest response to the bioclimatic indices as well as the highest potential for changing distribution pattern. Regarding individual traits, insects in general and ephemeropterans preferring very cold temperature showed the highest response, and the insects preferring cold and trichopterans preferring moderate temperature showed the highest potential for changing distribution. We showed that the seasonal radiation and moisture are the most influential bioclimatic aspects, and thus changes in these aspects may affect the most responsive traits and orders and drive a change in their spatial distribution pattern. Our findings support the development of trait-based metrics to predict and detect climate-related changes of freshwater assemblages.},

	abstract = {1. Accurately assessing the effects of multiple human-caused stressors on freshwater (and other) ecosystems is an essential step in the development of efficient decision support tools for environmental managers. Our objective is to review potentials and limitations of the use of biological traits as indicators ({BTIs}) of multiple stressor effects on running water (i.e. lotic) ecosystems. 2. Pioneers in ecology provided mechanistic explanations for responses of alternative biological traits to a given stressor and for the action of habitat harshness as a trait filter. These ideas were subsequently integrated in theoretical ecological constructs (e.g. Habitat Templet Concept) that form the basis of the {BTI} approach. 3. To resolve the effects of multiple stressors on running waters requires multiple traits of a biologically diverse group of organisms such as lotic invertebrates. To meet this goal, however, recently created databases on the biological traits of lotic invertebrates must be expanded and unified. 4. Addressing the technical implementation of the {BTI} approach, we illustrate that anticipated problems with phylogenetic trait syndromes are seemingly less serious in reality and that presence–absence data of genera and few sample replicates are sufficient for accurate trait descriptions of invertebrate communities. 5. Current trends in politics demand that biomonitoring tools be effective at large scales, i.e. large-scale trait patterns of natural communities (i.e. at reference conditions) should be relatively stable. The trait composition of natural invertebrate communities is relatively stable at the scale of Europe and North America because trait filters of natural lotic habitats act similarly across large biogeographical units. 6. The mechanistic actions of stressors on the biological traits of invertebrates should facilitate a priori predictions, but the complexity of potential trait responses makes such predictions sometimes difficult. 7. To illustrate potentials and limitations of {BTIs} to identify a given stressor acting exclusively (or primarily), we examine the (i) use of functional feeding groups to indicate the action of various stressors and (ii) trait responses to an indirectly acting stressor (discharge variation) and to a more directly acting stressor (near-bottom flow). If the excessive use of specific traits for the indication of too many different stressors is avoided and a given stressor acts directly on traits as a priori predicted, reliable interpretations of trait responses can be achieved. 8. To illustrate how {BTIs} can identify individual stressors acting in combination, we examine three cases of multiple stressors: (i) heavy metal pollution in combination with cargo-ship traffic; (ii) eutrophication and fine sediment deposits associated with land use; and (iii) various stressors associated with climate change in combination with salinity. If the number of the assessed traits is sufficiently great and the action of each individual among the multiple stressors is not too weak, multiple traits can potentially resolve the effects of multiple stressors. 9. Thematic implications: if the expansion and unification of existing trait databases can be achieved, the rapidly growing knowledge about biological trait responses of lotic invertebrates to individual and multiple stressors should enable the identification of management priorities focused on: (i) individually acting stressors (manage stressor A at site X prior to stressor B at site Y); (ii) multiple stressors acting in different combinations at different sites (manage stressors A \& B at site X prior to stressors C \& D at site Y); and (iii) individual stressors acting in combination (manage stressor A prior to stressor B at site X). Thus, the {BTI} approach has the potential to inaugurate a new era in the biomonitoring of lotic (and other) ecosystems.},

The trait approach offers a mechanistic alternative to traditional taxonomy-based descriptors. This review focuses on research employing traits as biomonitoring tools for freshwater ecosystems, although the lessons learned have wider application in the assessment of other ecosystem types. 2. We review the support from ecological theory to employ species traits for biomonitoring purposes (e.g. the habitat templet concept, landscape filtering hypothesis), and the subsequent studies that test the hypotheses arising from these theories, and apply this knowledge under real freshwater biomonitoring scenarios. We also include studies that deal with more specific issues such as trait trade-offs and trait syndromes. 3. We highlight the functional trait approach as one of the most promising tools emerging for biomonitoring freshwater ecosystems. Several technical issues are addressed and solutions are proposed. We discuss the need for: a broader unified trait biomonitoring tool; a more accurate understanding of the natural variation of community patterns of trait expression; approaches to diminish the effects of trait trade-offs and trait syndromes; additional life history and ecological requirement studies; and the detection of specific impacts under multiple stressor scenarios. 4. Synthesis and applications. This review provides biologists with the conceptual underpinning for the use of species traits as community descriptors and for freshwater biomonitoring and management. We expect that the functional trait approach will ultimately improve communication to managers and legislators of the importance of protecting freshwater ecosystem functions.},

As hypothesised, all three traits were strongly associated with long-term climate (annual precipitation and average temperature), whereas taxonomic richness had only weak associations with these climatic variables. Moreover, average hydroaerophily and rheophily of families in samples from the {MDB} decreased between 2004 and 2010 during the intense ‘Millennium Drought’, while average thermophily rose. These changes were reversed during 2010–2012 after the drought broke. Hydroaerophily, rheophily and thermophily were correlated with one another and with respiration mode, suggesting a trait syndrome related to adaptation to rhithron versus potamon and lentic environments. Hydroaerophily, rheophily and thermophily have the capacity to identify species that are vulnerable to future climatic warming and drying. These traits are also correlated with diet, indicating potential consequences for ecosystem processes of climate-related shifts in the composition of stream invertebrate assemblages.},

        abstract = {Forecasting responses of benthic community structure and function to anthropogenic climate change is an emerging scientific challenge. Characterizing benthic species by biological attributes (traits) that are responsive to temperature and streamflow conditions can support a mechanistic approach for assessing the potential ecological responses to climate change. However, nonclimatic environmental factors also structure benthic communities and may mitigate transient climatic conditions, and these must be considered in evaluating potential impacts of climate change. Here we used macroinvertebrate and environmental data for 279 reference-quality sites spanning 12 states in the western {US}. For each sampling location, we described 45 environmental variables that spanned reach to catchment scales and that represented contemporary climate drivers, hydrologic metrics, and nonclimatic habitat features, as well as purely spatial metrics. We described benthic community composition at each site in terms of 7 species traits, including those considered sensitive to temperature increases and streamflow changes. All combined environmental variables explained 67\% of the total trait variation across the sites, and catchment-scale climatic and hydrologic variables independently accounted for 19\%. Sites were clustered into 3 community types based on trait composition, and a classification-tree analysis confirmed that climatic and hydrologic variables were important in partitioning these groups. Sensitivity of benthic communities to projected climate change was assessed by quantifying the proportion of taxa at sites having the traits of either cold stenothermy or obligate rheophily. Regression-tree analysis showed that temperature and hydrologic variables mostly accounted for the differences in proportion of sensitivity traits across the sites. We examined the vulnerability of sites to climate change by superimposing regionalscale projections of late-21st-century temperature and runoff change on the spatial distribution of temperature- and runoff-sensitive assemblages. Sites with high proportions of cold stenotherms and obligate rheophiles occur throughout the western {US}, but the degree of temperature and runoff change is projected to be greatest for reference sites in the Upper Colorado River and Great Basin. Thus, our results suggest that traits-based sensitivity coupled with intraregional variation in projected changes in temperature and runoff will cause reference sites in the western {US} to be differentially vulnerable to future climate change.},

Such understanding could transform descriptive field studies in community ecology into predictive studies. Currently, however, trait-based approaches often fail to reflect species–environment relationships adequately. The difficulties have been perceived mainly as methodological, but we suggest that the problem is more profound and touches on the fundamentals of ecology and evolution. Selection pressures do not act independently on single traits, but rather, on species whose success in a particular environment is controlled by many interacting traits. Therefore, the adaptive value of a particular trait may differ across species, depending on the other traits possessed by the species and the constraints of its body plan. Because of this context-dependence, trait-based approaches should take into account the way combinations of traits interact and are constrained within a species. We present a new framework in which trade-offs and other interactions between biological traits are taken as a starting point from which to develop a better mechanistic understanding of species occurrences. The framework consists of 4 levels: traits, trait interactions, trait combinations, and life-history strategies, in a hierarchy in which each level provides the building blocks for the next. Researchers can contribute knowledge and insights at each level, and their contributions can be verified or falsified using logic, theory, and empirical data. Such an integrated and transparent framework can help fulfill the promise of traits to transform community ecology into a predictive science.},

However, to realize its full potential, a defined nomenclature for traits is urgently required, and significant effort is required to populate databases of species–trait relationships. Recently, there have been significant advances in the area of information management and discovery in the area of the semantic web. Combined with continuing progress in biological trait knowledge, these suggest that the time is right for a reevaluation of how trait information from divergent research traditions is collated and made available for end users in the field of environmental management. Although there has already been a great deal of work on traits, the information is scattered throughout databases, literature, and undiscovered sources. Further progress will require better leverage of this existing data and research to fill in the gaps. We review and discuss a number of technical and social challenges to bringing together existing information and moving toward a new, collaborative approach. Finally, we outline a path toward enhanced knowledge discovery within the traits domain space, showing that, by linking knowledge management infrastructure, semantic metadata (trait ontologies), and Web 2.0 and 3.0 technologies, we can begin to construct a dedicated platform for {TERA} science.

	abstract = {The linkage of trait responses to stressor gradients has potential to expand biomonitoring approaches beyond traditional taxonomically based assessments that identify ecological effect to provide a causal diagnosis. Traits-based information may have several advantages over taxonomically based methods. These include providing mechanistic linkages of biotic responses to environmental conditions, consistent descriptors or metrics across broad spatial scales, more seasonal stability compared with taxonomic measures, and seamless integration of traits-based analysis into assessment programs. A traits-based biomonitoring approach does not require a new biomonitoring framework, because contemporary biomonitoring programs gather the basic site-by-species composition matrices required to link community data to the traits database. Impediments to the adoption of traits-based biomonitoring relate to the availability, consistency, and applicability of existing trait data. For example, traits generalizations among taxa across biogeographical regions are rare, and no consensus exists relative to the required taxonomic resolution and methodology for traits assessment. Similarly, we must determine if traits form suites that are related to particular stressor effects, and whether significant variation of traits occurs among allopatric populations. Finally, to realize the potential of traits-based approaches in biomonitoring, a concerted effort to standardize terminology is required, along with the establishment of protocols to ease the sharing and merging of broad, geographical trait information.

	abstract = {Summary Biological traits of organisms are expected to provide increased mechanistic understanding of species?environment relationships. Linking traits to environmental conditions is, however, not straightforward, as traits are interconnected within species and can affect the adaptive value of each other. The aim of our study was to evaluate the importance of these trait interrelationships for understanding environmental responses of freshwater macroinvertebrates. To this end, we investigated whether environmental responses of macroinvertebrates sharing a given trait were consistent or differed according to their taxonomy or to their other traits. We divided the macroinvertebrates into groups based on single traits (49 single?trait modalities), on taxonomy (10 orders) and on their overall trait profile (10 trait profile groups [{TPGs}], defined using self?organising maps clustering). Abundances of each of these 69 groups were related to 24 environmental variables using boosted regression tree ({BRT}) modelling, to assess the environmental responses of single traits, orders and {TPGs}. Cross?validated predictive power (R2) of the {BRT} models ranged from {\textless} 1\% to 38\%. Environmental responses of macroinvertebrates sharing a given trait were inconsistent and varied according to order and/or {TPG}. Single?trait responses often reflected the responses of the most abundant taxonomic group expressing the trait, suggesting that analysis of trait responses simply revealed patterns in habitat use by the most abundant species and not necessarily mechanistic relationships. Further, taxa from the same {TPG} (hence showing large overlap in their traits) but belonging to different orders showed different environmental responses. This indicates that the order a taxon belongs to confers unique information related to its evolutionary history that was not captured by our 49 trait modalities. However, groupings by orders cannot replace trait?based approaches, since {TPGs} also revealed differences in trait profiles within some orders, which were associated with different environmental responses. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple rather than single traits when linking macroinvertebrates to environmental variables, including the potential information conveyed by evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {The use of species traits to characterize the functional composition of benthic invertebrate communities has become well established in the ecological literature. This approach holds much potential for predicting changes of both species and species assemblages along environmental gradients in terms of traits that are sensitive to local environmental conditions. Further, in the burgeoning field of biomonitoring, a functional approach provides a predictive basis for understanding community-level responses along gradients of environmental alteration caused by humans. Despite much progress in recent years, the full potential of the functional traits-based approach is currently limited by several factors, both conceptual and methodological. Most notably, we lack adequate understanding of how individual traits are intercorrelated and how this lack of independence among traits reflects phylogenetic (evolutionary) constraint. A better understanding is needed if we are to make the transition from a largely univariate approach that considers single-trait responses along single environmental gradients to a multivariate one that more realistically accounts for the responses of many traits across multiple environmental gradients characteristic of most human-dominated landscapes. Our primary objective in this paper is to explore the issue of inter-trait correlations for lotic insects and to identify opportunities and challenges for advancing the theory and application of traits-based approaches in stream community ecology. We created a new database on species-trait composition of North American lotic insects. Using published accounts and expert opinion, we collected information on 20 species traits (in 59 trait states) that fell into 4 broad categories: life-history, morphological, mobility, and ecological. First, we demonstrate the importance of considering how the linkage of specific trait states within a taxon is critical to developing a more-robust traits-based community ecology. Second, we examine the statistical correlations among traits and trait states for the 311 taxa to identify trait syndromes and specify which traits provide unique (uncorrelated) information that can be used to guide trait selection in ecological studies. Third, we examine the evolutionary associations among traits by mapping trait states onto a phylogentic tree derived from morphological and molecular analyses and classifications from the literature. We examine the evolutionary lability of individual traits by assessing the extent to which they are unconstrained by phylogenic relationships across the taxa. By focusing on the lability of traits within lotic genera of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, taxa often used as water-quality indicators, we show how a traits-based approach can allow a priori expectations of the differential response of these taxa to specific environmental gradients. We conclude with some ideas about how specific trait linkages, statistical correlations among traits, and evolutionary lability of traits can be used in combination with a mechanistic understanding of trait response along environmental gradients to select robust traits useful for a more predictive community ecology. We indicate how these new insights can direct the research in statistical modeling that is necessary to achieve the full potential of models that can predict how multiple traits will respond along multiple environmental gradients.},

	abstract = {Increasing salinity in freshwater ecosystems is globally widespread, especially, in arid and semi-arid regions, and can co-occur with ﬂow intermittency, particularly in temporary streams. Both these stressors are known to aﬀect macroinvertebrate traits individually, but their interactive eﬀects have not been previously considered. There are inconsistencies reported in the literature regarding the response of particular traits to ﬂow or salinity, and accordingly, we hypothesized that interactive eﬀects between these two stressors may underlie inconsistencies in the literature. We used multivariate and univariate approaches to investigate the eﬀects of salinity and ﬂow interactions on macroinvertebrate traits using 13 years of data sampled across multiple sites in South Australia, the driest state in the driest inhabited continent in the world. Ovoviviparity, multivoltinism, aerial respiration and strong ﬂiers were favoured as salinity increased, while medium-high physiological sensitivity to salinity and respiration via gills decreased. During low ﬂows, holometaboly, univoltinism, high rheophily, cool eurythermality, streamlined body shape and gill respiration decreased, while aerial respiration and ﬂiers and high crawling rate increased. Interestingly, traits with inconsistent responses (e.g. burrowing, tegument respiration and collector-gathering traits) in the literature were associated with interactions between ﬂow and salinity in our study. These traits showed a similar interaction, by being least abundant in streams with high salinity and low ﬂows, and low salinity and high ﬂows. The interactions seem to be driven by the diﬀerential response of diﬀerent taxa with the same trait category being abundant in diﬀerent parts of the interaction plot. Our ﬁndings suggest that, in addition to diﬀerences in methodological and analytical approaches, interactions may also underlie inconsistencies in trait responses to ﬂow and salinity. Finally, to foster the operative use of traits to resolve the eﬀects of multiple stressors on ecosystems, there is the need for a better mechanistic understanding of how speciﬁc stressors (e.g. ﬂow and salinity) act as trait ﬁlters, potentially through the use of experiments, to ensure that each of the stressors is strong enough to produce clear trait responses.},

This concept is currently developed in some water quality systems (e.g. Index of Trophic completeness) and the structure of functional feeding groups ({FFGs}) could form part of a unified measure across communities differing in taxonomic composition. However, in South America, information about the {FFG} classification of invertebrates in streams is almost absent and existing studies using {FFG} structure follows classification from North America. But even taxonomically related species may have different diets in tropical and temperate areas and therefore, studies about {FFG} structure in neotropics could be biased. For this reason, we determined diet composition, trophic level and {FFGs}, using gut contents analysis and mouthpart observations of 49 macroinvertebrate taxa (mostly at genus level) from neotropical streams. We observed that practically all macroinvertebrates fed upon fine detritus which indicates the importance of this food resource in neotropical streams. As the assignment to a single {FFG} does not accurately reflect the functional profile of taxa, we transcribed the affinity of taxa to each {FFG} using fuzzy codes. Finally, we published the coding of diet composition and {FFG} of the taxa examined, which could be used in future community analyses of lotic ecosystems in the Neotropical zone.},

	abstract = {Functional traits are increasingly being used to predict extinction risks and range shifts under long-term climate change scenarios, but have rarely been used to study vulnerability to extreme climatic events, such as supraseasonal droughts. In streams, drought intensification can cross thresholds of habitat loss, where marginal changes in environmental conditions trigger disproportionate biotic responses. However, these thresholds have been studied only from a structural perspective, and the existence of functional nonlinearity remains unknown. We explored trends in invertebrate community functional traits along a gradient of drought intensity, simulated over 18 months, using mesocosms analogous to lowland headwater streams. We modelled the responses of 16 traits based on a priori predictions of trait filtering by drought, and also examined the responses of trait profile groups ({TPGs}) identified via hierarchical cluster analysis. As responses to drought intensification were both linear and nonlinear, generalized additive models ({GAMs}) were chosen to model response curves, with the slopes of fitted splines used to detect functional thresholds during drought. Drought triggered significant responses in 12 (75\%) of the a priori-selected traits. Behavioural traits describing movement (dispersal, locomotion) and diet were sensitive to moderate-intensity drought, as channels fragmented into isolated pools. By comparison, morphological and physiological traits showed little response until surface water was lost, at which point we observed sudden shifts in body size, respiration mode and thermal tolerance. Responses varied widely among {TPGs}, ranging from population collapses of non-aerial dispersers as channels fragmented to irruptions of small, eurythermic dietary generalists upon extreme dewatering. Our study demonstrates for the first time that relatively small changes in drought intensity can trigger disproportionately large functional shifts in stream communities, suggesting that traits-based approaches could be particularly useful for diagnosing catastrophic ecological responses to global change.},

Adverse eﬀects on the biodiversity of freshwater organisms, such as macroinvertebrates, may propagate to associated ecosystem functions, such as organic matter breakdown ({OMB}). In this context, the functional diversity ({FD}) of communities has been suggested to be a more suitable predictor of changes in ecosystem functions than taxonomic diversity ({TD}). We investigated the response of {TD} and {FD} of invertebrate communities to an environmental stress gradient and the relation of both metrics to the rate of organic matter breakdown. For this, we sampled macroinvertebrates and determined {OMB} using leaf bags along an environmental stress gradient (i.e. changes in physicochemical and hydromorphological conditions) in 29 low-order streams. Taxonomic richness decreased with increasing environmental stress (r = −0.55) but was not related to {OMB}. Conversely, the Simpson diversity of communities was not associated with the gradient but correlated moderately (r = 0.41) with {OMB}. Of three functional diversity indices (functional richness, evenness and divergence), only functional richness correlated moderately with the stress gradient (r = −0.41) and any of the indices correlated with {OMB}. Nevertheless, functional metrics such as speciﬁc trait modalities and the total abundance of the dominant shredders correlated higher (r = 0.46 and 0.48) with {OMB} than the {TD} indices. Given a relatively small species pool in our study and methodical constraints such as the limited resolution of autecological information, the {FD} might perform better in other contexts and if focusing on response and eﬀect traits for the stressor and ecosystem function under scrutiny, respectively.},

Compared with existing open-access databases, we tripled the number of occurrence records and locations and added records for 118 genera. We also present life-history, dispersal, morphological and ecological traits and trait affinities (analogous to fuzzy-coded traits) for 1,007 stream insect genera, assembled from existing databases, reference books and the primary literature. We nearly doubled the number of traits for 11 trait groups and added traits for 180 genera that were not available from open-access databases.

	abstract = {Summary Other than some classical ideas, large?scale approaches to understand variation in organismal traits (or the trait composition of an ecological community) across stream ecosystems are rather recent. Recent case studies and review papers show clear evidence for the usefulness of trait?based analyses in bioassessment, but how community traits vary along natural gradients at large scales has not yet been synthesised. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by providing a synthesis of trait patterns of stream communities from a macroecological perspective. We argue that although both natural and anthropogenic filters shape community traits, examination of poorly understood natural filters, including those acting at large scales, should receive increasing attention. Such knowledge is vital for reliably inferring anthropogenic impacts on stream communities and ecosystems. We synthesise knowledge of two large?scale spatial patterns of stream communities: among drainage basins (i.e. geographical variation) and within drainage basins (i.e. longitudinal variation). We also examine the temporal dimension of organismal traits. Our review highlights clear evidence for large?scale influences on the trait composition in stream systems. For example, despite previous contentions that organismal traits should vary negligibly across large geographical gradients, there is actually clear geographical variation across near?pristine systems. Furthermore, in accordance with theory, organismal traits in actual data sets vary along the longitudinal gradient of stream systems. We provide an overview of empirical and statistical approaches to understanding the trait composition of stream communities in macroecological studies and conclude that the methodology should be carefully considered in comparisons among studies, because contrasting results may reflect not only ecological differences but also differences in methodology (e.g. choice of species traits, trait quantification and analytical methods). We conclude that the question of how the trait composition of stream communities varies along geographical and environmental gradients is far from settled. A challenge for large?scale stream ecology is to provide a more specific view of trait variation in multiple taxonomic groups (e.g. do traits vary similarly in different organisms groups?), along major environmental gradients (e.g. is trait variation similar along the same environmental gradients in different regions?) and among different regional entities (e.g. do the traits vary, on average, among different regions?).},

Applying a priori data on (i) national rarity (rarity model) and (ii) frequency occurrence at reference sites (quality model), the deviation of family trait descriptions was measured in relation to a nonweighted null model. Overall, the quality model was more divergent than the rarity model, reﬂecting the respective speciﬁc and general survey protocols associated with their source data. Assessing performance with contrasting datasets demonstrated that taxon-weighting provided improved accuracy even when survey protocols associated with model data and test sites were discordant. However, accuracy generally increased as the geographic coverage and sampling methods of weighted models and test data corresponded more closely. Measuring trait variability within families provides a useful indicator of the expected accuracy of generalized trait descriptions, while distinguishing variability in terms of even or skewed dispersion suggests options for the further reﬁnement of assessment protocols.},

However, further progress depends on overcoming three major challenges involving (a) statistical correlations between traits, (b) phylogenetic constraints on the combination of traits possessed by any single species, and (c) spatial effects on trait structure and trait–environment relationships. Here, we introduce a new framework for quantifying trait correlations, phylogenetic constraints and spatial variability at large scales by combining openly available species’ trait, occurrence and phylogenetic data with gridded, high-resolution environmental layers and computational modelling. Our approach is suitable for use among a wide range of taxonomic groups inhabiting terrestrial, marine and freshwater habitats. We demonstrate its application using freshwater macroinvertebrate data from 35 countries in Europe. We identified a subset of available macroinvertebrate traits, corresponding to a life-history model with axes of resistance, resilience and resource use, as relatively unaffected by correlations and phylogenetic constraints. Trait structure responded more consistently to environmental variation than taxonomic structure, regardless of location. A re-analysis of existing data on macroinvertebrate communities of European alpine streams supported this conclusion, and demonstrated that occurrence-based functional diversity indices are highly sensitive to the traits included in their calculation. Overall, our findings suggest that the search for quantitative trait–environment relationships using single traits or simple combinations of multiple traits is unlikely to be productive. Instead, there is a need to embrace the value of conceptual frameworks linking community responses to environmental change via traits which correspond to the axes of life-history models. Through a novel integration of tools and databases, our flexible framework can address this need.},

Such heterogeneity can be attributed, in part, to a lack of standards for acquiring, organizing and describing data. Here, we propose a terminological resource, a Thesaurus Of Plant characteristics ({TOP}), whose aim is to harmonize and formalize concepts for plant characteristics widely used in ecology. {TOP} concentrates on two types of plant characteristics: traits and environmental associations. It builds on previous initiatives for several aspects: (i) characteristics are designed following the entity-quality ({EQ}) model (a characteristic is modelled as the ‘Quality’ {\textless}Q{\textgreater} of an ‘Entity’ {\textless}E{\textgreater}) used in the context of Open Biological Ontologies; (ii) whenever possible, the Entities and Qualities are taken from existing terminology standards, mainly the Plant Ontology ({PO}) and Phenotypic Quality Ontology ({PATO}) ontologies; and (iii) whenever a characteristic already has a definition, if appropriate, it is reused and referenced. The development of {TOP}, which complies with semantic web principles, was carried out through the involvement of experts from both the ecology and the semantics research communities. Regular updates of {TOP} are planned, based on community feedback and involvement. {TOP} provides names, definitions, units, synonyms and related terms for about 850 plant characteristics. {TOP} is available online (www.top-thesaurus.org), and can be browsed using an alphabetical list of characteristics, a hierarchical tree of characteristics, a faceted and a free-text search, and through an Application Programming Interface. Synthesis. Harmonizing definitions of concepts, as proposed by {TOP}, forms the basis for better integration of data across heterogeneous data sets and terminologies, thereby increasing the potential for data reuse. It also allows enhanced scientific synthesis. {TOP} therefore has the potential to improve research and communication not only within the field of ecology, but also in related fields with interest in plant functioning and distribution.},

        abstract = {Chironomidae are among the most conspicuous and ecological diverse group of freshwater invertebrates. They may dominate unimpacted communities in abundance and biomass, accounting for more than 50\% of macroinvertebrate species in standing and flowing waters. In deep zones of eutrophic lakes and highly human-impacted streams, they are often the only family of aquatic insects remaining. In bioassessment programmes, Chironomids are often identified at the family and subfamily levels, due to difficulties in the taxonomic identification of larvae resulting from a high intrinsic morphological similarity. This may potentially result in bias as, similarly to Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera or Plecoptera, Chironomidae species, which are replaced along natural and human-impacted gradients due to differences in their ecological requirements. Recently, multiple trait-based approaches have been proposed to complement taxonomic-based assessment of streams and rivers using macroinvertebrates. However, the lack of specific trait information for Chironomidae prevents their use in the functional assessment of communities. Therefore, here, we aimed to: (1) develop a trait database for European Chironomidae genera that can be used in future bioassessment and ecological studies; (2) evaluate, by multivariate analyses, whether our new database provides additional information on Chironomidae compared to the trait information provided in the commonly used European trait database (Tachet et al., 2010); and (3) determine whether the new information on Eltonian traits (proxy to biological traits) translates the most accepted phylogenetic relationships among Chironomidae subfamilies. We gathered information on 744 species and 178 genera, for 37 traits covering 186 trait categories, and found substantial differences between our database and the commonly used European trait database. In addition, available information on traits was not always in agreement with phylogenetic relationships among subfamilies. Orthocladiinae and Chironominae which are considered sister groups in evolutionary terms actually showed confident trait relatedness based on Eltonian traits tree while the remaining relationships between subfamilies are questionable. In addition, different traits can occur in closely related taxa depending on the environmental drivers operating on their habitats. Our study reveals that the usually accepted redundancy within the Chironomidae family and subfamilies must be a product of averaging the information from finer taxonomic resolution added to the substantial lack of information for this insect group.},

        abstract = {We discuss the application of traits-based bioassessment approaches in retrospective bioassessment as well as in prospective ecological risk assessments in regulatory frameworks. Both approaches address the interaction between species and stressors and their consequences at different levels of biological organization, but the fact that a specific species may be less abundant in a potentially impacted site compared with a reference site is, regrettably, insufficient to provide diagnostic information. Species traits may, however, overcome the problems associated with taxonomy-based bioassessment. Trait-based approaches could provide signals regarding what environmental factors may be responsible for the impairment and, thereby, provide causal insight into the interaction between species and stressors. For development of traits-based ({TBA}), traits should correspond to specific types of stressors or suites of stressors. In this paper, a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats ({SWOT}) analysis of {TBA} in both applications was used to identify challenges and potentials. This paper is part of a series describing the output of the {TERA} (Traits-based ecological risk assessment: Realising the potential of ecoinformatics approaches in ecotoxicology) Workshop held between 7 and 11 September, 2009, in Burlington, Ontario, Canada. The recognized strengths were that traits are transferrable across geographies, add mechanistic and diagnostic knowledge, require no new sampling methodology, have an old tradition, and can supplement taxonomic analysis. Weaknesses include autocorrelation, redundancy, and inability to protect biodiversity directly. Automated image analysis, combined with genetic and biotechnology tools and improved data analysis to solve autocorrelation problems were identified as opportunities, whereas low availability of trait data, their transferability, their quantitative interpretation, the risk of developing nonrelevant traits, low quality of historic databases, and their standardization were listed as threats.

        abstract = {In studies using macroinvertebrates as indicators for monitoring rivers and streams, species level identifications in comparison
with lower resolution identifications can have greater information content and result in more reliable site classifications
and better capacity to discriminate between sites, yet many such programmes identify specimens to the resolution of family
rather than species. This is often because it is cheaper to obtain family level data than species level data. Choice of appropriate
taxonomic resolution is a compromise between the cost of obtaining data at high taxonomic resolutions and the loss of information
at lower resolutions. Optimum taxonomic resolution should be determined by the information required to address programme objectives.
Costs saved in identifying macroinvertebrates to family level may not be justified if family level data can not give the answers
required and expending the extra cost to obtain species level data may not be warranted if cheaper family level data retains
sufficient information to meet objectives. We investigated the influence of taxonomic resolution and sample quantification
(abundance vs. presence/absence) on the representation of aquatic macroinvertebrate species assemblage patterns and species
richness estimates. The study was conducted in a physically harsh dryland river system (Condamine-Balonne River system, located
in south-western Queensland, Australia), characterised by low macroinvertebrate diversity. Our 29 study sites covered a wide
geographic range and a diversity of lotic conditions and this was reflected by differences between sites in macroinvertebrate
assemblage composition and richness. The usefulness of expending the extra cost necessary to identify macroinvertebrates to
species was quantified via the benefits this higher resolution data offered in its capacity to discriminate between sites
and give accurate estimates of site species richness. We found that very little information ({\textless}6\%) was lost by identifying
taxa to family (or genus), as opposed to species, and that quantifying the abundance of taxa provided greater resolution for
pattern interpretation than simply noting their presence/absence. Species richness was very well represented by genus, family
and order richness, so that each of these could be used as surrogates of species richness if, for example, surveying to identify
diversity hot-spots. It is suggested that sharing of common ecological responses among species within higher taxonomic units
is the most plausible mechanism for the results. Based on a cost/benefit analysis, family level abundance data is recommended
as the best resolution for resolving patterns in macroinvertebrate assemblages in this system. The relevance of these findings
are discussed in the context of other low diversity, harsh, dryland river systems.},

        abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}{ABSTRACT}{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is still sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study and most monitoring methods are labour intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors that can effectively, continuously, and non-invasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the lab. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behaviour, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to the big data outputs to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) Validation of image-based taxonomic identification, 2) generation of sufficient training data, 3) development of public, curated reference databases, and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance statement{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Insect populations are challenging to study, but computer vision and deep learning provide opportunities for continuous and non-invasive monitoring of biodiversity around the clock and over entire seasons.

We present examples of sensors and devices of relevance to entomology and show how deep learning tools can convert the big data streams into ecological information.

        abstract = {Environmental policies increasingly focus on the enhancement of ecological functions across large geographical areas and thus call for biomonitoring tools that assess these functions at large spatial scales. A potential answer to this call would be to use general biological traits of organisms that in-dicate ecological functions, as such traits will be comparable among communities even across bio-geographic regions that differ in their taxonomic composition. Here, we used benthic invertebrates and European running waters as example to illustrate how multiple biological traits could provide a measure for the large-scale biomonitoring of the functional composition of communities. Our measure considered the relative abundance of 63 categories of 11 biological traits (such as size, re-productive and dispersal potential, food and feeding habits) that indicate various ecological func-tions. Comparing this measure for 10 most natural French reference regions with 37 other most natural regions/stream types scattered across Europe demonstrated an extremely high spatial and temporal stability of the functional composition of natural invertebrate communities at the Euro-pean scale. Thus, our functional measure corresponds to a fundamental standard for a large-scale biomonitoring tool, which is the stable and reliable indication of the natural reference state across ecoregions that differ more or less in their taxonomic composition. Applying our functional mea-sure to regulated stream sites below dams (in England, Finland and Spain) and to streams receiving sewage inputs (in Wales, Poland and Sardinia) demonstrated highly significant (p {\textless} 10 –6) differences in the functional composition between the human-impacted and the natural reference communities. In addition, some of the trait categories responded in a consistently contrasting way to each of the two types (regulation, sewage) of human impact. Consequently, our measure for the functional composition of invertebrate communities provides a first unified European baseline for future stream and river management: it was stable in the most natural but otherwise very different run-ning water types across Europe, it safely indicated human impact, and it could potentially discrimi-nate specific types of human disturbances. As all living organisms have multiple biological traits, our approach could serve to generate, for other types of communities and ecosystems, a set of large-scale biomonitoring tools that use similar and perhaps even comparable measures for the functional community composition.},
