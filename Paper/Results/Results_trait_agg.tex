\subsection*{Simulation of varying taxonomic hierarchies}

For the \textit{sim\_base} scenario the trait aggregation methods based on the mean result in the same ranges of aggregated trait affinities within each level of trait variation. Aggregation methods using the median yielded greater ranges of aggregated trait affinities than methods using the mean. Thereby, the \textit(stepwise\_agg \textsubscript{median}) yielded the greatest range of aggregated trait affinities (Figure S\ref{fig:overview_sim_results}).  By contrast, the ranges of trait affinities differed for all aggregation methods for the simulation scenarios \textit{sim\_extreme} and \textit{sim\_variation}. \textit{Weighted\_agg} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} produced a wider range of values than the \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} in the \textit{sim\_extreme} scenario. For most levels of trait variability the \textit{stepwise\_agg \textsubscript{median}} resulted in the largest range of trait affinities in both scenarios

Analysing the individual simulation runs showed that differences between the results of the aggregation methods increased with increasing trait variability. Most differences occurred for the \textit{sim\_extreme} scenario. Differences greater than an absolute trait affinity of 0.1 occurred between methods using the median and the mean. Thereby, the most frequent differences above 0.1 were found between the aggregation methods \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{mean}} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}}, and \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{weighted\_agg} (Figure S\ref{fig:sim_indv_runs}). 

\subsection*{Differences in trait affinities obtained by trait aggregation methods compared to traits assigned at family-level}
\label{sec:diff_trait_agg_chessman}

The percentage of differing cases of trait affinities obtained by the trait aggregation methods compared to trait affinities originally assigned at family-level varied between 16.2 \% and 22.9 \% for the Australian dataset. For the North American dataset, comparison of the trait aggregation methods to trait affinities assigned at family-level yielded between 15.3 \% and 47 \% differing cases (Table \ref{tab:summary_stat_aggr_vs_fam_assigned}).

In general, trait aggregation methods using the median yielded fewer cases with differences compared to approaches using the mean. However, aggregation methods using the median produced greater differences for both datasets. Standard deviations of absolute differences were similar for all tested aggregation methods. For both datasets maximum differences of 1 occurred for all investigated grouping features (Figure \ref{fig:diff_aggr_traits_chessman} and Figure \ref{fig:diff_aggr_traits_pyne}).

A comparison of the aggregation methods with each other for the 4 datasets revealed that differences in aggregated trait affinities were largest between the \textit{stepwise\_agg\textsubscript{median}} and \textit{direct\_agg\textsubscript{median}} (Figure S\ref{fig:comp_aggr_methods}).
