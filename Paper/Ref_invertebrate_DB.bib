Comprehensive databases compiling species traits are already established in the terrestrial realm, but widely missing in freshwater science. We established a database for European taxa of five aquatic organism groups by compiling information on taxonomy, ecology and distribution based on extensive literature surveys, which were performed by experts for the targeted organism groups. The database includes fishes (654 taxa/21 ecological preferences), macro-invertebrates (8586/40), macrophytes (1083/5), diatoms (8868/36) and phytoplankton (1976/4). It is available online with various options and tools for finding information and has currently over 800 users. The reviewed literature as well as examples given in this paper, highlight the importance of the general availability of knowledge on ecological preferences for various aspects in ecological assessment. Freshwaterecology.info is considered a service for basic research, applied scientists, water managers or other stakeholders. It serves as base for bioassessment and monitoring.},

To provide a framework for the trait analysis, a data base was developed; it stored biological information about 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa. Twenty-two variables describing biological and ecological traits were resolved into a number of simple attributes. A fuzzy coding procedure was used to describe the link between taxa and variables. Three strategies, using simple descriptive statistics or multivariate ordination techniques, were examined in their abilities to demonstrate some of the characteristics of the environment and to bring out clear information on the rate of changes in habitats. We used the Loire River, France, as a specific example. Like faunal analyses, trait analyses showed that a major change occurred in the community in the upper reaches of the river, but transition zones that were not detected with faunal data alone, were discriminated. They corresponded to differences in combinations of biological and ecological traits of communities and were linked to tributary influences (e.g. the Allier–Loire confluence) or anthropogenic disturbances: dams (Grangent, Villerest) or urban zones (Le Puy, Tours). We concluded that the species trait approach had the potential to evaluate the actual state of ecosystems, to discriminate among different types of human impact, and to develop monitoring tools considering the functional diversity of communities.},

	title = {A Database of Lotic Invertebrate Traits for North America},
	abstract = {The assessment and study of stream communities may be enhanced if functional characteristics such as life-history, habitat preference, and reproductive strategy were more widely available for specific taxa. Species traits can be used to develop these functional indicators because many traits directly link functional roles of organisms with controlling environmental factors (for example, flow, substratum, temperature). In addition, some functional traits may not be constrained by taxonomy and are thus applicable at multiple spatial scales. Unfortunately, a comprehensive summary of traits for North American invertebrate taxa does not exist. Consequently, the U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water-Quality Assessment Program in cooperation with Colorado State University compiled a database of traits for North American invertebrates. A total of 14,127 records for over 2,200 species, 1,165 genera, and 249 families have been entered into the database from 967 publications, texts and reports. Quality-assurance procedures indicated error rates of less than 3 percent in the data entry process. Species trait information was most complete for insect taxa. Traits describing resource acquisition and habitat preferences were most frequently reported, whereas those describing physiological tolerances and reproductive biology were the least frequently reported in the literature. The database is not exhaustive of the literature for North American invertebrates and is biased towards aquatic insects, but it represents a first attempt to compile traits in a web-accessible database. This report describes the database and discusses important decisions necessary for identifying ecologically relevant, environmentally sensitive, non-redundant, and statistically tractable traits for use in bioassessment programs.},

	abstract = {1. Using world-wide data on the reproductive biology of 131 species (in eight orders) of aquatic insects, we used multivariate analyses to examine: (i) relationships among reproductive traits determining life cycle, fecundity, morphology, behaviour and physiology; (ii) relationships among traits determining spatial and temporal habitat characteristics at different scales; and (iii) the relationship between reproductive and habitat-use traits. This provided a test of predictions of the habitat templet concept on trends of species traits along gradients of habitat heterogeneity. 2. The major trends observed in the relationships among reproductive traits were that larger females had larger eggs, which were more vulnerable to perturbations such as droughts and often laid in cocoons. In addition, they laid the eggs in larger numbers of smaller clutches than smaller females. Other traits (e.g. egg number or incubation time) did not show clear trends. 3. Females that deposited eggs at sites of low local temporal heterogeneity (within plants) used, at the same time, gross habitats of high temporal heterogeneity (temporary waters). In contrast, traits in habitat use hardly differed on well-known gradients of temporal heterogeneity along running waters (from source to estuary). The number of habitat units used by ovipositing females generally increased with the spatial scale considered, most species oviposited in a single small habitat unit but in several gross habitats. 4. A significant (P {\textless} 0.01) relationship between traits in reproduction and habitat use demonstrated that habitat acted as a templet for reproductive strategies. This relationship was dominated by larger females having larger, unattached eggs which were more vulnerable to droughts and were oviposited in temporally more stable small-scale habitats (within wood or macrophytes, or within cocoons spun by the female) but more unstable large-scale habitats (primarily temporary waters). Thus, only on the small habitat scale did some of our observations correspond to the predictions of the habitat templet concept (e.g. larger size or higher vulnerability in more stable habitats). However, many species had traits in reproduction that did not show trends as predicted by the concept. 5. This and other recent studies of the relationships between traits of freshwater organisms and the heterogeneity of their habitats have shown that habitat acts as a templet for species life history traits. However, many of the details observed in these studies did not correspond to predictions of the templet concept because of trade-offs among the traits and scale problems in the description of habitat heterogeneity. Therefore, future studies should focus on groups of organisms which are as similar as possible in the trade-offs among their species traits and on the potential relationships of habitat heterogeneity across multiple scales.},

	abstract = {1 Relating species traits to habitat characteristics can provide important insights into the structure and functioning of stream communities. However, trade-offs among species traits make it difficult to predict accurately the functional diversity of freshwater communities. Many authors have pointed to the value of working with groups of organisms as similar as possible in terms of relationships among traits and have called for definition of groups of organisms with similar suites of attributes. 2 We used multivariate analyses to examine separately the relationships among 11 biological traits and among 11 ecological traits of 472 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa (mainly genera). The main objective was to demonstrate (1) potential trade-offs among traits; (2) the importance of the different traits to separate systematic units or functional groupings; and (3) uniform functional groups of taxa that should allow a more effective use of macroinvertebrate biological and ecological traits. 3 We defined eight groups and 15 subgroups according to a biological trait ordination which highlighted size (large to small), reproductive traits (K to r strategists), food (animal to plant material) and feeding habits (predator to scraper and/or deposit feeder) as ‘significant’ factors determining the ordination of taxa. This ordination partly preserved phylogenetic relationships among groups. 4 Seven ecological groups and 13 ecological subgroups included organisms with combinations of traits which should be successively more adequate in habitats from the main channel to temporary waters, and from the crenon to the potamic sections of rivers, and to systems situated outside the river floodplain. These gradients corresponded to a gradual shift from (1) rheophilic organisms that lived in the main channel of cold oligotrophic mountain streams to (2) animals that preferred eutrophic habitats of still or temporary waters in lowlands. The groups with similar ecological traits had a more diverse systematic structure than those with similar biological traits. 5 Monitoring and assessment tools for the management of water resources are generally more effective if they are based on a clear understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the presence or absence of species groups in the environment. We believe that groups with similar relationships among their species traits may be useful in developing tools that measure the functional diversity of communities.},

The main question was: Are biological traits able to reflect “biological functionality” in large rivers and if so, is it possible to deduce an assessment system based on functionality? Analysis of the raw trait structure of all species indicates that these traits are not completely independent from their higher systematic units. To avoid mis-interpretations when judging from mixtures of habitats (β-biocoenosis) we used for our investigations only sample series from α-biocoenosis, pre-tested by a mathematical criterion of homogeneity. Within α-biocoenosis, traits are shown to be able to compensate for drastic changes with respect to species number and species composition along a river continuum, demonstrating their functional quality. Long-term changes in the trait and species structures of German waterways were studied using multivariate methods, based on an analysis of 142 sampling series. A shift from traits typical for K-strategists to traits typical for r-strategists was detected to be the main background variable. The {rK}-strategy is regarded as a true functional character of species. We calculated the relative positions of all trait-coded species on this {rK}-scale, and plotted the functional diversity of our samples against the structural diversity of the species from several river systems. Rivers extremely dominated by r-strategists show a deficit in functional diversity. Rivers dominated by K-strategists also show deficits, possibly in concordance with modern ecological theories such as the intermediate disturbance theory. The quantitative proportions of extreme r- to K-Strategists in α-biocoenosis can be used as a general disturbance measure.},

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} 1 We present an unconventional procedure (fuzzy coding) to structure biological and environmental information, which uses positive scores to describe the affinity of a species for different modalities (i.e. categories) of a given variable. Fuzzy coding is essential for the synthesis of long?term ecological data because it enables analysis of diverse kinds of biological information derived from a variety of sources (e.g. samples, literature). 2 A fuzzy coded table can be processed by correspondence analysis. An example using aquatic beetles illustrates the properties of such a fuzzy correspondence analysis. Fuzzy coded tables were used in all articles of this issue to examine relationships between spatial?temporal habitat variability and species traits, which were obtained from a long?term study of the Upper Rhône River, France. 3 Fuzzy correspondence analysis can be programmed with the equations given in this paper or can be performed using {ADE} (Environmental Data Analysis) software that has been adapted to analyse such long?term ecological data. On Macintosh {AppleTM} computers, {ADE} performs simple linear ordination, more recently developed methods (e.g. principal component analysis with respect to instrumental variables, canonical correspondence analysis, co?inertia analysis, local and spatial analyses), and provides a graphical display of results of these and other types of analysis (e.g. biplot, mapping, modelling curves). 4 {ADE} consists of a program library that exploits the potential of the {HyperCardTM} interface. {ADE} in an open system, which offers the user a variety of facilities to create a specific sequence of programs. The mathematical background of {ADE} is supported by the algebraic model known as ?duality diagram?.},
