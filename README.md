## Content overview

### - /Cleaned_data

Contains the preprocessed and harmonised trait datasets for each continent and region as *rds file*.

* "Trait_continent/region_preproc.rds": preprocessed and cleaned trait dataset (e.g. handling of duplicates, addition of taxonomic nomenclature, etc.)
* "Trait_continent/region_harmonised.rds": harmonised trait datasets

### - /Paper

Contains TeX files for the paper

### - /R

Contains R scripts for preprocessing and harmonisation. The raw data could not be provided but can be obtained from the respective providers of the trait databases (e.g., https://www.freshwaterecology.info/ ).

All R Scripts beginning starting with *02_* or higher can be reproduced with the data provided in **-Cleaned data**.
